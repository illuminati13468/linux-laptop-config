Linux Ansible Playbook


## The programs that need to be installed are:
#

#vagrant
#git
#virtualbox
#ansible
#atom editor
#sublime editor
#snapd
#pycharm
#microsoft teams

#I suppose that something like ansible to should be present when running the playbook. However it should be possible to run a bash command prior to ansible, to install the ansible package and git. The rest should be installable via ansible.
